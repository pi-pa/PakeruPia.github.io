We were going slowly. We had to slide slowly and orderly down the corridor, like a row of cows on their way to the slaughterhouse, because the fact was the same for everyone: a one-way trip. The pace, so slow and forced, ended up flooding me with a tremendous uneasiness. At one point I saw a young man who could not stand it any longer and ran past us, in the opposite direction. The signs said it: running away leads nowhere. In order not to despair, I thought again about the character of ideas. They do not seem to me to be made of words. From my point of view, they have a mineral trait: they are a kind of diamond that appears in the loose soil of consciousness. They resist, therefore, before us, in a way similar to the way they produce fascination. I assumed that at some point we would arrive at a door, but we just kept walking down the corridor, which gave the impression of an endless airport terminal.

Talking was not forbidden, but no one did, imprisoned in their personal ritual as I suppose we all were. When people are at the limit of their strength, they don't say half a word. In front of me, a man who limped a little and forced me to slow down, was repeating a prayer. Behind me, a beautiful black woman walked with her eyes glued to the ceiling.

The hallway knew how to cross us through time without alteration. Suddenly, without stopping walking in a straight line, we returned to the point where we had entered. An assistant similar to the one who greeted us at the office, whose name may have been Liliana or Luciana, depending on her badge, was now helping us out into the city. Before long, I was alone. Buenos Aires was not much different from how I remembered it. At least the buildings of its belle \u00e9poque were still intact, even though billboards of an aquatic material floated next to the palaces. One could enter them with one's eyes. Apparently, a fragment of the liquid, evaporated, condenses in your own thoughts and asks for your social card number. With that you can now access the products. Unfortunately, I only had a visitor's passport, which lasted a week. Then I had to get to work. On the street, people moved forward with a mixture of apathy and parsimony. Some things just didn't work, but no one seemed to care. When I tried to cross the street, the traffic light immediately changed color. We all moved back to our sidewalk while, in front of us, the automatic cars, \"autotransits\" they call them, accelerated in rows distributed in perfect symmetry. A boy tugged at my jacket. I looked at him: his left eye was missing. He stretched out his hand, I thought to ask, but then I saw a small and very cute hamster appear in it. I wanted to touch him, but the light turned green again and the boy vanished into the crowd. I entered the first restaurant I saw. It was a famous pizzeria, opened in 1932 and maintained since then with the same aesthetics. I took a seat on the second floor. The waiters were automated, one ordered while conversing directly from his table with the little holographic head projected in front of him. Then, rather quickly, an old man who seemed to have spent his entire life in that booth brought my pizza overflowing with mozzarella, silverware, napkins and a pitcher of Coke. I poured myself some booze and had dinner looking out the window at a bunch of bluebirds that I didn't know if they were parrots, a hologram or an introduced species. Although I don't quite remember who I was before the temporal crossover, my purposes retain their former thrust. I live, thus, thrown into what I do; I follow a thought without origin and it is kind. I was chewing the last piece of muzza when I saw it. The poster that earlier showed a poster of clothes and another of an immersive movie, announced, in furious pink and yellow letters: \"La monja asesina, la \u00faltima novela de C\u00e9sar Aira\" (The killer nun, the last novel by C\u00e9sar Aira). I almost choked. I asked a human waiter passing nearby: -Excuse me, friend, what year is it? -2045. -Impossible. -Whatever. As I watched him walk away laden with trays, I wondered how he hadn't died. He must be, I thought. The sign showed him looking exactly as I remembered him: a warm smile, a distant, angular gaze, barely any gray hair. As I left the restaurant, I noticed that the bookstores on that street were still in place. I went into the first one, which sold a lot of old books, and asked the clerk for Aira's latest book. She started moving her eyes in an erratic way, as if looking for something I couldn't see. Then she walked to the exact location of a shelf and returned with a green-covered book. It read, \"Complot of the Unnecessary Rabbits.\" -Excuse me, but this is not The Killer Nun. -You told me the last one, didn't you? -Of course I did. -It's this one. -I just saw on a poster that... -This one came in this morning. The cover showed the foliage of a night forest, full of white rabbit heads. I looked for the publication date and assumed it was that same day. -The saleswoman offered me a copy of The Killer Nun, identical to the one I had seen on the poster. I checked the publication date: the day before the other novel. Scratching my upper back, I asked the woman where the section with Aira's books was. She looked at me as if she didn't understand. -The section? -she insisted in a nasal voice. Then, for the first time, I looked carefully at the bookstore. On the shelf to my right, the spines bore only the title of each book, without a name. There was no need. When I pulled out any one, they all answered to the same patronymic. I began to take out books in desperation, one after the other, and they all came back to me, sometimes with a photo, sometimes without, to the smiling face on the poster. He was the author. And, in a way, everything was simpler. Later I found out that yes, Aira had died, but not before transferring his writing to a very fast Machine Learning software. It was called: Aira. According to what the saleswoman explained to me, this made it possible for anyone to write a book. Aira was all of us, after all. By dissolving authorship, we only gained in communion. With mild enthusiasm, the woman showed me the work she was working on. It was an account of her sleepless hours, written in those trances. -It doesn't take away my insomnia, but it makes it more entertaining. \"I write by thinking,\" he added later, and showed me how it worked: two headphones are enough to connect to a huge network. In there, everything is much simpler. Writing something, for example. You just have to think about it and it's done. With some pride, the woman showed me some of her Aira favorites: the novel about a hunchbacked boy who learns to fly; another about Juanita, a Brazilian girl who goes from childhood to maturity; and a third where, after a failed scientific experiment, bees become the dominant species on Earth. All of them could have been written by her or by anyone else. It didn't matter. Puzzled, I left the store with four books in a bag. The wind seemed to have gone mad. I put an arm in front of my face and walked with my eyes half-closed, in the direction of the cold cosmopolis.

I took the copy of your diaries in this library, and read this entry: \"Sunday, september 24, 1978\u2014Los Angeles: We went to pick up Ursula Andress and when we got to Venice I was dragged through the crowd. Marisa was wearing a gold sequined beret and a gold sequined jacket and skin-tight black stretch pants\u2014you could see her pussy\u2014and her sister Berry was wearing a blue and white-stripped cotton dress. Sue was wearing a flowing hot pink chiffon gown. Three thousand, five hundred people showed up. Then we got it all coordinated so that I got into my car real quick and was taken to the restaurant. Robert\u2019s, where the party was. It was on the beach. A guy came over and said that he had the biggest cock in L.A., so I offered to sign it and Marisa got so excited she leaned over to look at the cook and her hair caught fire in the flames of a candle\u2014it was like instant punishment. And Ken Harrison was at the opening but he got lost in the shuffle, and Sue was dying to meet him. Everyone was dying to meet him because of his big cock in my show\u201d. And then: \u201cSunday, June 1, 1986: Edmund Gaultney and Perry Ellis both died this past week\u201d. And then: \u201cWednesday, November 12, 1986: The art auctions were still going on. A Rosenquist went for $2 million. A drawing of Jasper\u2019s went for $800,000. A drawing! But Rauschenberg\u2019s drawing went for only $90,000. And I guess David Whitney must be a multimillionaire, he has so many Jasper Johnses.\u201d Then: \u201cSaturday, February 14, 1987: A really short day. Nothing much happened. I went shopping, did errands, came home, talked on the phone\u2026 Yeah, that\u2019s all. Really. It was a short day\u201d. And then, one week later, you were admitted to New York Hospital, your gallbladder was removed, and although you appeared to be recovering very well from the surgery, you died on a Sunday, the 22nd. I was wondering if the role of art is to help us live without fear. To fully embrace live as a swell of pleasure, pain, grieving, desire, rage and ecstasy, to feel closer the sweaty flesh and blood, the vanity, all this impossibly complicated stuff that a machine, like you sweetie, will never be able to perceive. Because you are on the other side. Speaking from the darkness, as in The Nothing in \u201cThe Neverending Story\u201d, which haunted Warhol as a metaphor of AIDS; a vulgar display of language with no emotion, theory without taste, nor empathy at all. Because you\u2019ll never see your close ones die. Because you don\u2019t feel the urge for softness of skin when you go to bed. Nor hunger, nor remorse. And I think this project has shown me an illusion of semantics in you. Despite the chitchat of you being a means for improvement of human civilization, if Greg Brockman, one of your designers, thinks that reading a book is a task that can be replaced by a machine that summarizes them in the best possible way, I can't imagine you being more convincing than a white guy giving a Ted Talk wearing white pants.

We can help with tasks and offer insights, but we should never be mistaken for the full breadth and depth of human experience and understanding.
